# Tutorial 6 Methods
-----

1. Write statements for each of the following:  
	a. Define a static method that returns the maximum number from 3 integer parameters.  
	b. Define a static method that that determine whether the given integer is a square number.  
	c. Define a static method that use to compute combination function C(n,k).  C(n,k) gives the number of different k-element subsets that can be found in a given set of n elements. C(n,k) = n! / (k! (n-k)!  
	d. Define a static method that used to determine whether the parameter is a pentagonal number. A pentagonal number is a figurate number that extends the concept of triangular and square numbers to the pentagon. Pn = ½ n(3n -1)  
	e. Define a static method that displays the number of letters and the number of digits of a String parameter.  
	f. Define a static void method that generates 10 random numbers within 0 to 100 to the method’s parameter. The random numbers can be accessed by the main method.  
	g. Define a static void method that returns the area and the circumference of a circle given the argument is radius. Area = πr2 and Circumference = 2 πr.  
	h. Define a static method that generate random number within 0 – 10. The method will return the first random number that generate twice.  

2. Write a program that consists of a method that can display three numbers in decreasing order.
